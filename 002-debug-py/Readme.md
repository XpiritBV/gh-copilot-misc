In the empty debug.py file, open copilot and write "Give me the Python code to prompt for 2 numbers from the user and perform division."

Run the debugger with breakpoints to catch the exception.

Copy the error and ask copilot to explain the error, like: "fix the following error in the file: Exception ...."
